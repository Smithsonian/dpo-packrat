There are two versions of Packrat deployed at the Smithsonian, Production and Staging. Each can be accesssed in two ways, depending on whether you are working behind the Smithsonian firewall:
1. Production: the official system of record for 3D data. **Do not use this for testing!**
    - Behind the Smithsonian firewall: [Login](https://packrat.si.edu/)
    - Using Smithsonian telework: [Login](https://packrat-telework.si.edu/login)
2. Staging: used for Packrat testing and training
