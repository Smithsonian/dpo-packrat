| 3b. When creating a new Media Group, pick the appropriate digitization Project, then indicate if the Media Group is the entire Subject. Provide a subtitle -- this is required when the Media Group is not the entire Subject. Subtitles will inform the ultimate display name of Scenes created from Media Group(s) | [![Packrat Ingestion New Media Group](/dpo-packrat/images/packrat-ingestion-5.png "Packrat Ingestion New Media Group")](/dpo-packrat/images/packrat-ingestion-5.png) |
