### Repository Browser
Clicking on "Repository" in the left navigation brings the user to the repository browser:
![Packrat Repository Browser](/dpo-packrat/images/packrat-repobrowser-1.png "Packrat Repository Browser")
1. **Repository Filter**: use the controls here to filter the results of what is displayed in the Repository Contents section below (item 5). For example, the results here have been filtered to show only things created on or after 3/29/2022.

2. **Filter Toggle and Link Icons**
    - The ^ icon is used to collapse the filter, providing more screen real estate for the Repository Contents below.
