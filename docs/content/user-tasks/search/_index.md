Use the "Search Repository" box at the top of Packrat to perform a keyword search of the repository contents. Click "Search" or hit enter after supplying search text.

When searching, the display of repository contents is updated with objects that match the specified search text.  If the search is performed from within the repository browser page, any selected repository filters are applied to the search results.  If the search is performed from a different Packrat page, all repository filters are removed.

Search tips:
* Packrat's keyword search functions similarly to that of major search engines
* Surround text with double quotes to require that exact text to be matched
* Packrat will search for objects with matching identifiers, such as ARK IDs and EDAN MDM IDs
* Capitalization is ignored

As always, you can copy and share the Packrat URL representing your search results to bring another user (or yourself) to the selected portion of the repository.
